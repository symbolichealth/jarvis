# Jarvis
Jarvis is an LLM powered personal assistant that can do generally useful things, such as:
* Notion project manager
* Deep research that is configurable
* Data miner
* Financial advisor
* Logistics planner
* Diagram creator
* Rubber ducky

The only real requirement is that the repo should be plug-n-playable, anything else is really just a suggestion. Ultimately, users should be able to fork the repo, run `./jarvis ...` and get utility.
