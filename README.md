# Jarvis
Jarvis is an LLM powered personal assistant that can do generally useful things, such as:
* Notion project manager
* Deep research that is configurable
* Data miner
* Financial advisor
* Logistics planner
* Diagram creator
* Rubber ducky

The only real requirements are:
1. The language has to be golang (sorry, I've been burned by python)
2. The repo should be plug-n-playable

Anything else is really just a suggestion. Ultimately, users should be able to fork the repo, run `./jarvis ...` and get utility.
